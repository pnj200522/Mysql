SELECT E.EMPNO, DEPTNO
FROM EMP E NATURAL JOIN DEPT D;

SELECT E.EMPNO, D.DEPTNO
FROM EMP E NATURAL JOIN DEPT D;  //오류남... 공통된 컬럼에 알리아스를 없애줘야함.

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, DEPARTMENT_ID, E.MANAGER_ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES E NATURAL JOIN DEPARTMENTS D;              //E.MANAGER_ID의 알리아스를 제거해 줘야함. 

##3-WAY JOIN

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME, STREET_ADDRESS

WHERE E.DEPARTMENT_ID = D. DEPARTMENT_ID
AND D.LOCATION_ID = L.LOCATION_ID;

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME, STREET_ADDRESS
FROM EMPLOYEES E JOIN DEPARTMENTS D
ON E.DEPARTMENT_ID = D.DEPARTMENT_ID
